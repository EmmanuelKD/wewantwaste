## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

This is the frontend for the Blog Platform project, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelKD/wewantwaste.git

```

Replace the link with the actual frontend repository URL.

# or
yarn install
```
